      <h2>Sekhmet</h2>
      <p>In Egyptian mythology, Sekhmet or Sachmis, also spelled Sakhmet, Sekhet, or Sakhet (among other spellings), is a warrior goddess as well as goddess of healing. She is depicted as a lioness, the fiercest hunter known to the Egyptians. It was said that her breath formed the desert. She was seen as the protector of the pharaohs and led them in warfare. Upon death, Sekhmet continued to protect them, bearing them to the afterlife.</p>
      <p>Sekhmet is also a solar deity, sometimes called the daughter of Ra and often associated with the goddesses Hathor and Bastet. She bears the Uraeus, which associates her with Wadjet and royalty, and the solar disk.</p>
